# Description
In this project, we tackle the problem of a low-cost supermarket chain trying to decide in which area of Madrid (Spain) they should open their new store in order to maximise the revenue. It is important to note that the city of Madrid consists of 21 districts and 131 neighbourhoods with great differences between them.

# Methodology

The neighbourhoods of Madrid are analysed with the purpose of finding the ideal location for a new
low-cost supermarket. We apply machine learning techniques such as k-means clustering to find
different clusters so that we could focus in only one type of neighbourhood (residential). Further data
such as population and market venues will be used to reduce the number of potential areas.

Above we can clearly see that Villaverde Alto looks the optimal neighbourhood since the household
income is clearly under average (around 26K â‚¬) and there are very few supermarkets for the amount
of population in the area.

However it would also be recommended to consider other similar areas such as Portazgo that is also
located on the bottom-right corner of the plot.
It is also interesting to mention that even though the low amount of existing supermarkets in
Mirasierra does clearly not cover the demand of the neighbourhood, it would be a convenient place
for a high class market since the household income there is at the very top.
